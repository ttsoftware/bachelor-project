# bachelor-project
To run the code go to code/ruby and execute 'src/run-benchmark.rb'.

This will run the benchmark on all of the .pat files under code/patscan-patterns/benchmark
and generate result files for each implementation (ruby, re2, python, scan-for-matches).

The test suite will run in ~2 hours.

Each of the seperate implementations can also be run seperately under:

Python: code/python/main.py <file.re> <file.fa>
Ruby: code/ruby/re-scan.rb <file.re> <file.fa>
RE2: code/c++/main <file.re> <file.fa>
scan-for-matches: code/scan_for_matches/main.py <file.pat> <file.fa>

Scan-for-matches requires that you have 'scan_for_matches' installed and available in your $PATH.
RE2 requires that you ahve libre2 installed. Our modified version can be found at https://github.com/ttsoftware/re2
Ruby requires ruby 2.2.
Python requires python 2.7.
